vRig is a Windows C# / .NET 4.0 application to communicate with
with modern amateur radio transcievers using RS-232 / CAT protocols.
The 1.0 version of vRig only supports Icom based transcievers.
Support for other makes and models is anticipated.

Public release of vRig is through http://w1jeq.net/software/ and
I hope to include many ideas and options that are brought to the
project through the open source community.

For more info on this project you are welcome to email me at
mchambers@w1jeq.net with your questions and comments.
